Hello there!

I'm thrilled to announce that I've just pushed my first commit to Git! 🚀

This marks the beginning of my journey into the world of version control and collaborative development. I'm excited to learn and grow as a developer, and Git will be an invaluable tool in my toolkit.

Here's to many more commits, merges, and collaborations ahead!

Keep coding and keep pushing! 🖥️💪

Best regards,
Ekeno Ephraim
